  <h1>Call to End Policing at Rush University Medical Center</h1>

  <p><strong>To our allies in the Rush University Medical Center administration:</strong></p>

  <p>As current Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) students, staff, and recent alumni, we demand the RUMC administration take immediate action to divest from policing and reinvest in our local communities to promote health and safety.</p>

  <p>Decades of structural violence and racism have led to pervasive inequities in health, wealth, and safety on the West Side. RUMC is already deeply involved and invested in improving the health and vitality of West Side communities through multiple partners, such as West Side United -- the demands of this petition align with and complement that work. Just as RUMC has been a national leader during the COVID pandemic, RUMC must be a national leader in addressing systemic racism in our communities and therefore within our healthcare system. This requires <strong>terminating any relationship with the Chicago Police Department (CPD), calling on the City of Chicago to defund CPD</strong>, <strong>disarming RUMC security</strong>, and <strong>investing in restorative justice </strong>practices and <strong>community-led safety initiatives</strong>.</p>

  <p>Policing has served as state sanctioned violence to uphold white supremacy since its inception. From slave patrols to arresting Black people for trivial offenses in order to legally enslave them again, and from enforcing Jim Crow to being an agency of mass incarceration today, policing is a violent enforcer of systemic racism in America. Such a flawed institution cannot be reformed, and cannot be supported by anchor institutions such as RUMC.</p>

  <p>We must divest from CPD to protect and support our Black, Brown, and Indiginous community members. The CPD has a long 
    <a href="http://wechargegenocide.org/chicago-police-history/">history of racism</a> and is one of the most violent police forces in the <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/compare-police-departments">country</a>, that disproportionately affects Black people. From 2013 to 2019, <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/cities">73%</a> of those killed by CPD were Black, despite making up only <a href="https://censusreporter.org">29%</a> of Chicago's population. An email sent to all RUMC employees on June 4, 2020 and again on August 11, 2020, stated that CPD patrols increased around the Medical Center. A police presence on RUMC's campus directly endangers our Black and Brown community members and opposes the work essential to RUMC's anchor mission to improve the health of the individuals and diverse communities we serve.</p>
  
  <p>Many institutions have already acted to dissolve or limit their relationships with local law enforcement. At the <a href="https://time.com/5843911/george-floyd-death-university-of-minnesota-police/">University of Minnesota</a>, President Joan Gabel committed the university to no longer contract with the Minneapolis Police Department law enforcement. At <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/06/15/johns-hopkins-presses-pause-private-police-force-plans">Johns Hopkins University</a>, officials have suspended former plans to create an armed campus police force in favor of discussing police reform at the institution. Complementing the pressure from protests and petitions, students at institutions such as <a href="https://www.tuftsforblacklives.com/divest-from-tupd">Tufts</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UMB2Swb3dHFOWibpvfOdL2d7CDorBf94jqfUfhrY8qg/edit">Northwestern</a>, and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HpsfYSAxeagcgL7Jcp9VA6Evv9axBRCJJMcgVwy-k1E/viewform?edit_requested=true">University of Washington</a> are posing similar demands to cut ties with local and state law enforcement and disarm campus security.</p>

  <p>We therefore call on RUMC to specifically address the following demands:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Define and publicly release the institution's existing written or verbal relationships with CPD, including financial investments and protocols in clinical settings</li>
    <li>Commit to no longer utilizing police at any location</li>
    <li>Publicly release demographic data of the students, faculty/staff, patients, and community members involved in interactions with campus and hospital security officers and develop a clear action plan to address racist inequities in security interactions</li>
    <li>Release demographic data of all individuals currently employed with RUMC security</li>
    <li>Release the current policies and procedures for hospital security at bedside and around all RUMC facilities as well as identify how security guards are trained in regards to non-lethal methods for de-escalation and racial bias</li>
    <li>Commit to deweaponization of all campus security officers and create explicit policies regarding unacceptable use of force by security guards, with documentation and transparency for all such events</li>
    <li>Release the annual budget allotted for hospital security and commit to reallocating those funds to alternative strategies for supporting people in crisis as well as programs supporting BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) patients and staff</li>
    <li>Release examples and outcomes of previous attempts at forming de-escalation teams within RUMC and why previous attempts have been denied</li>
    <li>Form and train a rapid response team for de-escalation without use of security staff to alleviate incidents without force</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Acknowledging <a href="http://rush.edu">RUMC's current work in the community</a>, we demand that RUMC:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Invite community members to a series of conversations hosted within the practices of restorative justice and institutional accountability</li>
    <li>Commit to revising its mission with the West Side to incorporate needs expressed, including but not limited to, safety, housing, mental health, and social support services</li>
    <li>Build on existing work with community organizations and partner with CDPH's Public Mental Health Clinic Service Expansion Task Force to improve mental health and social support services on the West Side, including building additional mental health centers to expand services</li>
    <li>Build upon existing Mental Health First Aid training to offer free trauma-informed care, anti-racism, and de-escalation workshops for staff, students, and community members</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In solidarity,<br/>
  Students/Staff Optimistic for Anti-Racism (SOFAR)</p>
